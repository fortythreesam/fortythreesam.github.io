<PRE>The Money Store - Death Grips
A Album review by Sam Drugan
Copyright 2017 Sam Drugan
RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>

<P>The Money Store turns out to be one of the worst albums of the list.
Listening to The Money Store,  gave me an intense sense of sadness, not about 
the lyrics but about the album and what it says about the current state of the music industry
. This lifeless album is never about anything other than its noise. 
</P>
<P>The albums's only saving grace?  It's short -- although not nearly short
enough.  Maybe you'll be lucky, and
there'll be a power outage during your listening so you can get your time
back.</P>
<P>The Money Store runs 41:08.  It is rated R for "strong violence" and
would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
